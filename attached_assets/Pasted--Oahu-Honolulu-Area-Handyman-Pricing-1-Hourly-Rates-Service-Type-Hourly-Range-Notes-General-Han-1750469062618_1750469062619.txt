Bundles & discounts â€“ encourage job bundling (e.g. "book 2, get 10% off").

Custom quotes for larger jobs â€“ anything over 4 hours should be quoted with certainty.

Clear material markup rate â€“ e.g., "materials billed at 30% markup".

Competitive edge â€“ position as mid-to-high quality with local convenience.
