🧠 Spank School: Problem Solver
Step-by-Step Home Troubleshooting Assistant

🛠️ 1. Faucet Won’t Stop Dripping
Step 1: Where is it leaking from?
💧 Tip of the spout → Likely a worn cartridge or washer

💧 Base of handle → Likely a loose packing nut or o-ring

Step 2: Shut off water valves under the sink
Step 3: Identify faucet type
🧩 Cartridge

🔩 Compression

🧽 Ball / Ceramic Disk

Step 4: Replace the faulty part
Cartridge = pull + swap

Washer = unscrew + swap
📍 Still leaking? → Call Spank. You may have a cracked valve seat.

🚽 2. Toilet Keeps Running
Step 1: Open the tank
Is water level too high? → Adjust float height

Is flapper not sealing? → Replace flapper

Is fill valve hissing? → Replace fill valve

Step 2: Shut off water and replace broken part
📍 Still running? → Call Spank. Your overflow pipe or flush valve seat may be damaged.

⚡ 3. Outlet Isn’t Working
Step 1: Try a different device or lamp
Still dead? → Continue

Works fine? → Problem is with the original item

Step 2: Check the circuit breaker
Tripped? → Flip it OFF then ON

GFCI outlet? → Press RESET

Step 3: Test with voltage tester
No power at all → Outlet or wiring issue
📍 Still no power? → Call Spank for safe outlet replacement.

🚿 4. Low Water Pressure in Faucet
Step 1: Check hot vs cold water
Only hot? → Water heater issue

Both? → Likely the aerator is clogged

Step 2: Unscrew and clean the aerator
Step 3: Check supply valves (fully open?)
📍 Still low pressure? → You may need a pipe flush or full fixture replacement.

🌀 5. Slow Drain or Smell from Sink
Step 1: Pour hot water (not boiling)
Smell gone? → It was likely a grease clog

Still there? → Proceed

Step 2: Use baking soda + vinegar
Fizzing = working

Wait 10 mins and flush

Step 3: Snake the drain
📍 Still clogged or smelly? → Trap may need to be removed or drain re-vented
